üêç My personal journey through LeetCode, solving problems with Python. A practice log for data structures and algorithms.

Welcome to my repository! This is a personal collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems, written in **Python 3**. The main purpose of this repository is to document my learning process, track my progress, and solidify my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

I use this repository as a portfolio to showcase my problem-solving skills. Feel free to browse, but I highly encourage you to try solving the problems on your own before looking at the solutions here!

## üìÅ Repository Structure

All solutions are organized into folders based on their difficulty level for easy navigation.

### Folder Structure
The problems are categorized into `Easy`, `Medium`, and `Hard`.

### File Naming Convention
Each solution file follows a consistent naming format to make it easily identifiable:
`ProblemNumber-ProblemTitle.py`

For example, the solution for LeetCode problem #1, "Two Sum", is named `1-TwoSum.py`.

🐍 My personal journey through LeetCode, solving problems with Python. A practice log for data structures and algorithms.

Welcome to my repository! This is a personal collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems, written in **Python 3**. The main purpose of this repository is to document my learning process, track my progress, and solidify my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

I use this repository as a portfolio to showcase my problem-solving skills. Feel free to browse, but I highly encourage you to try solving the problems on your own before looking at the solutions here!
